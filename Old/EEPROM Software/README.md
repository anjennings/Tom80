# Software for EEPROM Read/Write* EEPROM_Write.py	* `python EEPROM_Write.py filename [filesize]`	* write bin file to EEPROM starting at location 0x0000	* filesize is optional base 10 number, only locations between 0 and filesize will be written to	* Assumes you are using COM3 by default	* Baud Rate and COM port must match the programmer	* Plays a bell '\a' sound when finished* EEPROM_Read.py	* `python EEPROM_Write.py filesize`	* read EEPROM data into file called `rom.dat`	* reads bytes from locations 0x0000  to filesize* RIG.py	* **R**om **I**mage **G**enerator	* `python rig.py [-h] [--c configfile] file1.bin file2.bin â€¦`	* Takes specified files and combines each into one large rom image with specified offsets	* If run without a config file, user will be prompted for starting locations of each bin file in rom image.  These offsets are saved into a file called config.cfg for future use.  Each offset is base 16	* If run with `--c` option, file offsets will be taken from config file	* If run with `-h` a help message will be displayed (ignores all other arguments)

# Tom80 V1.X

![alt text](https://github.com/anjennings/Tom80/blob/Version-2.0/Photos/Tom80.jpg?raw=true)

Two versions of V1 exist:
	V1.0 - Never got it working, only version assembled was scrapped for parts
	V1.1 - The one in all the pictures
	
See the video about it : https://youtu.be/3KAjZbjPqnA
	
This version has no persistant memory or way of keeping time so an OS wouldn't really be worth the effort
It can run basic and looks nice on the shelf

# PIO/PROPELLER Communication ProtocolThis document outlines the "language" that the CPU and the PROP use to communicate with each other.The Propeller does 3 main things:* VGA Text / Plaintext Terminal * PS/2 Keyboard* SD Card / Disk Drive EmulatorPIO Initiates all communications for now by asking for an operation (read Input, print character, read sector, etc.), an interrupt driven approach for replies could be implemented but that would require more overhead.## PIO -> PROP Characters* 0x00 - 0x7F 	* Ascii Character	* Single Byte, CPU anticipates no replyTODO:* Read from PS/2* Open Disk image* Move to locations in disk image (reflects operations in CPM)* Read disk sectors* Write disk sectors

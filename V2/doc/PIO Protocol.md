# PIO/PROPELLER Communication ProtocolThis document outlines the "language" that the CPU and the PROP use to communicate with each other.The Propeller does 3 main things:* VGA Text / Plaintext Terminal * PS/2 Keyboard* SD Card / Disk Drive EmulatorPIO Initiates all communications for now by asking for an operation (read Input, print character, read sector, etc.), an interrupt driven approach for replies could be implemented but that would require more overhead.## PIO -> PROP Characters### Ascii* 0x00 - 0x7F 	* Ascii Character, printed to screen	* Single Byte	* Returns nothing### Testing* 0x80	* Call and Response Sanity Check	* Can be used by Z80 to detect if Propeller is disabled	* Single Byte	* An ascii character should be returned### Disk I/O* 0x90	* Set track in "disk"	* Double byte, expects track number to follow	* Returns nothing* 0x91	* Set sector in track on "disk"	* Double byte, expects sector number to follow	* Returns nothing* 0x92	* Open disk image	* Double byte, expects drive letter (A, B, C, …) to follow	* Expects .img file to be present on disk	* Returns nothing* 0x93	* Load currently selected sector into RAM and prepare to read	* Single byte	* Returns nothing* 0x94	* Read next byte of currently selected sector	* Single byte	* Returns single byte of data* 0x95	* Load currently selected sector into RAM and prepare to write (identical to 0x93)	* Single byte	* Returns nothing* 0x96	* Write following byte of currently selected sector	* Double byte, expects data to follow	* Returns nothing* 0x97	* Flush write from buffer to disk	* After calling 0x96 multiple times to write data into the buffer, commit buffer back to disk	* Single byte	* Returns nothingTODO:* Read from PS/2* Reset instruction

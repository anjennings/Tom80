# PIO/PROPELLER Communication ProtocolThis document outlines the "language" that the CPU and the PROP use to communicate with each other.The Propeller does 3 main things:* VGA Text / Plaintext Terminal * PS/2 Keyboard* SD Card / Disk Drive EmulatorPIO Initiates all communications for now by asking for an operation (read Input, print character, read sector, etc.), an interrupt driven approach for replies could be implemented but that would require more overhead.## PIO -> PROP Characters### Ascii* 0x00 - 0x7F 	* Ascii Character, printed to screen	* Single Byte	* Returns nothing### Testing* 0x80	* Call and Response Test	* Single Byte	* An ascii character should be returned as a sanity check.### Disk I/O* 0x90	* Go to track in "disk"	* Double byte, expects track number to follow	* Returns nothing* 0x91	* Go to sector in track on "disk"	* Double byte, expects sector number to follow	* Returns nothing* 0x92	* Open disk image	* Double byte, expects drive letter (A, B, C, â€¦) to follow	* Maybe create file if none exists?	* Returns nothing* 0x93	* Load currently selected sector into RAM and prepare to read	* Single byte	* Returns nothing* 0x94	* Read next byte of currently selected sector	* Single byte	* Returns single byte of data* 0x95	* Load currently selected sector into RAM and prepare to write	* Single byte	* Returns nothing* 0x96	* Write following byte of currently selected sector	* Double byte, expects data to follow	* Returns nothingTODO:* Read from PS/2* Open Disk image* Move to locations in disk image (reflects operations in CPM)* Read disk sectors* Write disk sectors

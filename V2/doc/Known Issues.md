# Known Issues for V2.0:* Reset logic only seems to work sometimes	* PIO can not be reset without manually shorting M1 pin to ground (possibly related)	* May be related to chip(s) used for testing.  One of my Z80s may be burned out* Voltage regulator footprint is designed for TO-220FP, not an issue per say but LF33 is easier to find in non-FP package* Interrupt logic for peripheral chips is open drain, schematic and glue logic does not reflect this	* To enable interrupts the CTC & PIO /INT lines must be shorted together, pulled high through a resistor, and wired to Z80 /INT* RAM Banking is wired incorrectly and lacks appropriate logic	* Manually bodging the top 4 lines of the RAM chip and an unused OR gate could allow for a simple banking system
